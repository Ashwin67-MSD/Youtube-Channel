Hello everyone! It's me Ashwin Krishna.R. I study at 8th grade. I am guy who loves to be famous like many Youtubers. 
That's the main reason for me to start a YouTube Channel and post a lot of videos to make myself famous!! And That's
what is happening right now!! Just 6 hours ago, I tasted the feel of how a youtuber feel when he/she get 100 
magnificient people who support him!! I feel like I have reached 1 step towards the feel of becoming famous!! Which
was really like eating a cheese fondue(Its my favourite food)!! If you're one of my subscriber, Imagine that I am
giving you a hug :) I also like to play games! My favourite games are Shadow Fight 2 and Among us!! And I am a pro 
in both of the games!! And I also like to read many comic books, especially Geronimo Stilton and Tinkle. That is 
all about me!!
